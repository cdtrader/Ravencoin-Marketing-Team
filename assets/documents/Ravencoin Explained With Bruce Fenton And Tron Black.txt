## Interview
Donald MacIntyre>
hello I'm Donald MacIntyre founder of
Etherplan, this is Etherplan live and
joining us are Bruce Fenton and Tron
black of Ravencoin

Donald MacIntyre>
Hello Bruce, Hello Tron, how are you?

Bruce Fenton>
Hello, thanks for having us.

Donald MacIntyre>
Thank you very much for your time and
we're going to talk about Ravencoin
today. My first question is if
you can tell me what is Ravencoin like
short story?

Tron Black>
Sure, the very very short
version is it's a clone of Bitcoin
that's going to be used as a platform
for assets.

Donald MacIntyre>
I saw in the white paper
that you're going to add assets, changes
to OP_RETURN messaging and also pay
dividends. Let's start with the
assets. How are those going to work? Are
they going to be like smart contracts
similar to Ethereum or is it another
kind of way of solving that? 

Tron Black>
It's a different way of solving it. Ravencoin,
you could add RSK to it if you wanted to.
That's not how we're adding assets. We're
going to add assets similar to the way
let's say Omni or Counterparty or one of
those layer two solutions, only
we're going to integrate it in, which
makes it a more integrated solution. 

Donald MacIntyre>
So in my mind Ethereum, ERC20 smart contracts 
are like an app on top of the protocol. In this case
the assets are going to be part of the protocol?

Tron Black>
Yeah, so the assets will be built into the
protocol, it will act like an erc20 except
it will have some differences. It will have the
contract ID, the asset names will be unique
which is some of the things that we can
do with smart contracts 

Donald MacIntyre>
Okay, are the smart contracts going to have
capabilities like: all types of corporate
actions?

Tron Black>
No, that's possible with some of the other 
technologies but this one will not be a like
a reversible or "stop it from trading" that kind of thing
this is a token thats just a tradable token

Donald MacIntyre>
By corporate actions I mean for example dividends or
stock splits or... 

Tron Black>
So probably not stock splits. Dividends- that would be one of
the ones that we will be able to do. Those will be distributed, the
value will be distributed via raven and it's not a dividend that you
can save like a master note or something like that. This
is something where if you have the token and then you wanted 
to reward the token holders for whatever activities they do,
you could get raven and distribute it to
those same token holders

Donald MacIntyre>
I saw in the white paper that when someone creates a token and gets a name for example art
and then that is a top layer token and could then create a sub-domain for a specific piece of 
art, for example, Mona Lisa. How is that going to work?

Bruce Fenton>
So the protocol will allow creation of unique assets and
limited assets and also fungible assets so you could create a
million shares of XYZ corp, you could create ten thousand tokens of
game gold, or you could create 100 platinum swords in a game
or you could create one platinum sword. So what this
does is allows you to do a lot of different interesting things with share
classes so you could have a million shares of class A shares and two hundred thousand
shares of Class B shares and those could have different rights and different
powers and receive different dividends or have different messaging the same way
that would be for a public equities type usage. You could also use it in a game
so that a game could have a certain game items that allows them to get quests
or something like that and they would receive communications on that.

Donald MacIntyre>
So there's going to be a layer which
is the general class of a token and then
you can create sub classes and the sub
classes can be used for different
corporate actions or subdivisions of
types of owners or you can attach
specific assets which are off blockchain
assets? 

Tron Black>
I think, a different way to think
of it is the owner of the original asset,
let's say of art, could create sub assets 
-again at the top layer they're the only
one that could create that sub asset. We
have examples of this like a game company could have
sub tokens for each of their games but
then under that they could also have
individual unique assets that they send
that are actually game rights

Donald MacIntyre>
okay and all this is related to
messaging, so how would the messaging
functionality work? 

Tron Black>
so the messaging functionality is a one way. 
You can think of it as one of the
problems that you have with existing systems out there. By existing
systems I mean the stock market. If you
try to collect all of the information
you want to send out- let's say a notice
to vote a proxy vote, you need to go to a
company that then collects from all
the different various parties, it will cost you
a bunch of money just to collect their
mailing address, and then you have to pay
a bunch of money to mail out information
to them with proxy forms etc. This(Ravencoin) would
allow you to communicate in that kind of
one-way fashion such as if I wanted to
communicate with all my token holders, I
want to say there's a vote or what
should we do, or whatever kind of messaging you want to send.
It's a one-way broadcast only the
token holders can broadcast. It's
not a spam channel. 

Donald MacIntyre>
When I create a token, the donald token for
example, I'm going to have different
classes of shares or different types of
assets. I can have those two layers
and I can send messages to all the
owners of those tokens 

Tron Black>
correct

Donald MacIntyre>
and then every now and then whenever it's
applicable, I can pay dividends. How does
the dividend function work is it similar?

Tron Black>
let me ignore the regulations for a minute because in some
jurisdictions this isn't allowed in
other jurisdictions it is, but basically
you would take the value, turn it into
Raven, (Raven will have some value) and
then you would broadcast that raven and
the software will take care of the
details. So you want to send it to Donald.token 
holders you basically say just
send this to Donald.token holders.
There will be an exceptions list that
you can say well, "I own some of these
donald tokens that I haven't distributed
yet I don't want to send
those to myself" so you can put those in
the exception list and then all the
other Donald.token holders will get a
prorata share. You won't know
necessarily who those donald tokens
are owned by or what address is
their's but it kind of doesn't matter, you just
distribute the raven prorata across the field.

Donald MacIntyre>
My last question about about
the the structure of the assets and the
functionality- Bruce maybe maybe this is
for you- this corporate action thing.
Corporate actions have have many colors:
sometimes it's just to pay a dividend,
and sometimes it is to do a stock split,
sometimes it is to pay a dividend in stock,
sometimes it is to just withdraw the whole
issuance and change it for a new issuance.
It can take many colors- do you think
that the this functionality is going to
enable that? 

Bruce Fenton>
Well there's quite a bit of
what we can do already and I think 
probably/ideally some of those things can be
added on in a second layer so it doesn't
need to be something that is messed with
in the code. If you look at what bitcoin
can do, for example there's quite a bit
that it can do and the tokens that run
on top of this platform will be able to
do that. One interesting point that's
worth mentioning since you were talking
about what Tron just mentioned, about the
how you have to go to get a list if
you're a publicly traded company for
example. That's a really key point
because a lot of people don't understand
this, a lot of people that are Bitcoin
maximalists like me or people who've been
in crypto a while they say, "well you
don't need this because you're already
relying on a trusted third party" and
that that's correct, but what they don't
understand is that in the way that
capital markets work right now- 
you don't just rely on the issuer you're
not just trusting Apple to not steal
your shares.
Nobody's really worried about Apple
stealing your shares. The current way that
it works- there's a whole bunch of
intermediaries. Because a lot of techies
come from startups they assume that you
have a cap table. They assume that Apple
has some list somewhere of shareholders
because their little startup has it but
that's not the way that works in the
real world. Apple doesn't have a list of
their shareholders. Overstock or
IBM or Microsoft- they don't have these
lists. They have to rely on third parties.
They could never manage a database. So a
lot of people make an erroneous
assumption of assuming that this is only replacing an internal
database and if it is already an internal
database then a blockchain will be redundant.
We're not solving for that, we're solving for these
trusted third-party intermediaries like
DTTC, DTCC, Cede&Co, clearing firms, and transfer
agents.(We're solving for) this whole huge complex
process where you have this this broken
antiquated distributed network that custodies
the ledger and what a project like this would allow
or bitcoin or any any other good blockchain would allow 
is that ledger to be put on a blockchain so that 
is the important distinction. 

Donald MacIntyre>
That definitely cuts all the layers that the
traditional system has now today. Apple
has their own registrar and there's one
ledger there where they only see Cede&Co as their
owner and Cede&Co turns around and
then there's a second a ledger which
is DTCC and they keep a ledger of all
the banks and brokers that own the
shares of Apple and then all the banks
and brokers have their own ledgers
where they know which are the retail
clients or the final clients. 
So there's three ledgers and it's very complicated 

Bruce Fenton>
The only reason you know that is because
you were a stock broker just like I was 
a stock broker. There's no way you would know
that (otherwise) so a lot of people don't understand
how this actually works in the industry.

Donald MacIntyre>
So the idea is that when I have for example a
share of a corporation on Ravencoin, I am
going to receive a message directly from
the issuer saving time and cost and price and money-
so that brings me to the question, who
are the target users? It seems obvious
that corporations are, but in general who
are the the users that you see issuing
assets on Ravencoin? 

Tron Black>
We have lots of use cases that we've written
down. I think that's going to be up to the users to
decide what use cases fit best. So I mean I can name a 
bunch, but I think as a protocol it's very good.

Bruce Fenton>
Securities issueance would be high on the list 

Donald MacIntyre>
For corporations, securities for example
could be bonds or it could be equity 
issuers in general. and I heard on your
tweet storm, Bruce, you mentioned gamers. Did you see a
particular use case for gamers? 

Bruce Fenton>
Yes see it seems cool. I think that particularly
with the unique items, it was it was Tron's idea to come up with
unique items, which is kind of like any
erc721 sort of token-

and I don'tknow if there's many applications for
unique tokens for securities. They're
certainly limited numbers so you could
have twenty people that are founders and
five hundred that are class A whatever seed investors
and then you can have the rest so you
could you could tier it out which is
very useful so you could you can
actually invent new ways of doing equity
that are much more seamless. I don't know
of (examples) unless you have like a super
share where you know that the founder of a
of a public company gets a share or
something like that

-but for gaming I
think it's really natural and
I always thought gaming, I know it's a
cutthroat and hard business I've never
had any experience in gaming unlike
securities, but it seems like it's fun so
you know personally I think it'd be
great if some gaming people who have
expertise in that can find some use of
this chain.

Donald MacIntyre>
As an entrepreneur, one thing
that occurred to me is to use raven coin
to start a company. For example, I want
to start  X company with Tron and Bruce
and and usually we would go to Delaware
and get a corporation there. Do you see
like creating/replacing that Delaware
corporation here on Ravencoin and doing
like a startup company?

Tron Black>
I love that idea.
There's some rules in the US that
prevent some of that but
jurisdictionally it works
everywhere you could create tokens that
represented part of a
project and then reward the
early investors through the
system. So I mean the protocol will
allow for it.

Donald MacIntyre>
We could use the protocol for the hard stuff and
then some contracts on top between us to
recreate the other parts that
are needed for the corporation maybe?

Bruce Fenton>
Then, what an actual use that you can have for unique token, is you could have a
CUSIP number or some similar number- maybe the world invents something new that replaces
CUSIPs but you could issue a million tokens and each one of them could be unique.
That would be a lot of work but you could issue a bunch of unique tokens and have
actual specific tokens tied to a legal document where a company says, "yes, this
token means that you own this, or this number of tokens means you own that". 
And again people say, "oh you're trusting a third party" but you're already trusting them. 
Now if you think the company that you have equity with is
going to steal your cup- for one thing that's not a very common problem- very
very rarely do you hear Apple or somebody stealing their 
certificates saying, "oh we're not going to honor your certificates". 

It does happen, and there are weird
things- there's a case with DOLE foods, where there was forty six million claims
on, I think, thirty nine million shares so there's brokers that will lie
and say you have shares when you don't really have them. Those problems
exist but they're not super huge. 

But the moving in a round thing would be a pretty good killer app
and maybe you tag- it might be too much work to do it- but maybe you
tag individual assets and say, "this matches this" or "this share class
matches these CUSIP numbers" and then all you need is a document from a
corporation that says yes this is really a share. And again, if you're already
trusting the corporation, you already have that document when
you have a share so the only real argument would be if somebody says "No
shares are ever going to be worth anything, corporations are going to cease
to exist, nobody's going to own equity in anything". 

The disconnect of saying well here's a token and here's a
share that there is a ton of legal problems with that there's legal
problems all surrounding it with whether you're a broker or not
selling securities without a license,all these kind of things. 

But there's no rules that say and we've looked at this
with council for a lot, there's nothing that says that you can't represent your
share in a digital form that that is a token. 

Tron Black>
(Ravencoin) solves the DOLE problem, if you
not familiar, look up the DOLE
shareholder thing where there were more
shares than were issued. We do solve that.

Donald MacIntyre>
Well now, the DOLE problem was
that there's the ability to short shares-
so that creates shares through the
lending process and that's another
blockchain issue. Here on the
protocol layer you just have a stock of
tokens, say a million shares and it's
never going to change and that
is protected with the security of a
blockchain. When they're off blockchain
there are markets, and people are lending
those shares and and creating more
shares through contracting that's a
different issue I think. The other thing that you
said Tron, is that when this is a
protocol and it crosses all boundaries.
So it seems you're concerned with
the functionality of the protocol but
one question that I had is, for example,
in the case when Bruce mentioned that 
you connect a work of art, which is off blockchain,
or when you connect the shares of Apple which is
which the relationship with Apple. Apple
is off the blockchain and I depend on
Apple to send the money to the
blockchain and pay me the dividends is
there something thought out for that? 
How to trust minimize the external part?

Tron Black>
There's nothing specific that can link the real
world to the tokens. The tokens will
operate like an erc20 token but there's nothing in the
protocol that's going to link that token to the real world. 

Bruce Fenton>
Or it will operate like a physical share. You
can have a share that, as you know Don from being a stockbroker,
(that people) still have paper shares from IBM that 
are 50 years old, 30 years old, and those shares are still honored.
If you have a bearer instrument or even if
you have a digital share or more modern share,
those are honored by the company and
that just becomes an issue of "is
the company honoring what they say"(or) "are
they paying dividends when they say" and
and then you know you could go in there
and have just as a hard (copy)
A court case isn't going to say, "well wait a minute Apple
said this this paper certificate counts as a share and they 
also said this digital thing called the token counts as
a share", unless of course they said, "oh we're not going
to acknowledge the second piece". 

But you can have it all through legal documents and everything,
where Apple says yes these are real shares just like they say certificates.
(You can't) be going with a fake certificate they won't honor it but if
you go in with a real certificate they will. 

Tron Black>
There will be some metadata that you can connect to these(tokens), so someone
could connect a document, you know a signed document, to the tokens so there will be
some metadata that you can associate with the tokens that will be
off chain but will be hashed so that you know the document hasn't been changed.

Donald MacIntyre>
Very good. Okay let's go to the history of Ravencoin. When when did you
think about it, and when was it launched, and what is the current situation?

Tron Black>
well I'll let bruce answer that one.

Bruce Fenton>
So it's an ongoing, evolving idea. The binaries were
launched on January 3rd 2018, and there was an 
announcement on medium on October 31st 2017. The medium
article sort of... it was kind of the announcement date of Bitcoin
and if you noticed in the whitepaper we put a little paragraph in 
there as kind of a thing for the Bitcoin developers, so it was a little homage to
Bitcoin. (We did this for a couple of) reasons. 
Bitcoin's (timing of launch and announcement was maybe) a good
practice and you can't really say it's too long or too 
short(of time between announcement and launch) if
it's the same one Bitcoin did. So we did the "why" on 
the original, sort of very basic, medium article on October 31st, 2017,
and the binaries were (launched) January 3rd, 2018.  
There were announcements in between, we tried to announce
it to about a hundred thousand people
through social media (and) we've spoken at a few
different events and meetups so we definitely wanted to
make it a fair launch, so that plenty of people would have a
chance to to mine it when it started. 
And that seemed to work, the network grew pretty fast. Tron can
talk a little bit about how the network has grown 

Donald MacIntyre>
So it's been working,physically, the network, since January 3rd.
People started to download the node-

Tron Black>
Yeah what we did was, you could CPU mine
on day one. It was a different(new) algorithm
so there was no GPU miners out for it. So
that lasted maybe two, three weeks and then
they created GPU miners and the network
grew a lot faster than we expected.
The mining has really taken off.

Donald MacIntyre>
So people can (mine) it using CPUs and GPUs? 

Tron Black>
You could mine with a CPU, (but) that's not really practical at
this point. It was practical probably for about two three weeks.
Now GPUs are more practical. 
I mean you can mine it with anything- you could mine it with pencil
and paper if you want to but its really slow.
CPUs are better but they are still probably not paying for your
electricity(in mining returns) and GPUs are the best solution at the moment. 

Donald MacIntyre>
What is the size today of (the total amount of) miners? 

Tron Black>
I don't know how many miners (but) we
have about a couple TH/s of mining and each one of
those Tera-hashes is actually sixteen hashes. 
That averages about four times more work than a Bitcoin hash
so that would kind of be the math to figure out how much work that is. 
We're still a fraction, a small fraction, of bitcoins network hashing 
power, but it's but it's growing pretty quick(ly) and its pretty strong.

Donald MacIntyre>
So are there miner only nodes and economic only nodes
or is it like bitcoin in the beginning?

Tron Black>
(The nodes) are (one in the) same thing. You can open
your router and help the network by
opening your router and getting more
connections and then basically route the
connections to other people so that's
helpful but for the most part it's
people mining that really brings the strength(to the network).

Donald MacIntyre>
(Do) you know how many transactions per day the network is
processing ?

Tron Black>
I don't have a count on that.

Bruce Fenton>
We've done, let's see, 822,000
transactions so far it looks like,
and as far as number of miners and nodes
I think it's something like seven thousand nodes.
It's really hard(to estimate) you
with mining pools but certainly I think we could
conservatively say over 20,000 *likely people.
Maybe people have multiple computers, but even
accounting for that, there's 20,000+ connections or so.

Donald MacIntyre>
And Tron, you are the lead developer, but how many developers are
in the expanded team?

Tron Black>
Here we have about six people,and another one starting on april 16th.
Then we have community developers. So we have people that are
working on an Android wallets and helping out with an iOS wallet. So some
community(development) and a lot of development here.

Donald MacIntyre>
When you say "here" you mean there at your team?

Tron Black>
(Here) is (where) we're getting help
from Medici, funding their
developers to work on this project.
We're also soliciting community developers, with all the help we can get.
We have a road map I think that we'll get more community developers once
we solidify the first round which is a little bit technical. (It) requires a lot of
lot of people working closely together but at some point we'll want more.

Donald MacIntyre>
So your hosted at Medici, which is in Salt
Lake City, Utah. It's a VC firm (and) it's
helping the project.
What is the functionality that is available today on
Ravencoin? Is it like pretty much Bitcoin today?

Tron Black>
Pretty much bitcoin. A little faster- one minute
blocks and faster issuance rates of 5000 instead of 50. 
So ultimately 140 years from now there will be a thousand times more
coins than there will ever be for bitcoin. 
So 21 billion with a b instead of 21 million with an m, 
ultimately, but it's still issuing right now. 

Donald MacIntyre>
But in terms of functionality are the issuance of
tokens, messaging Dividends the OP_RETURN changes?

Tron Black>
We're in the process of building that. We'll do hard fork or
otherwise known as an upgrade when the functionality is ready. 
That will be released as a hard fork.

Donald MacIntyre>
Okay so for now it's a fork of
Bitcoin, very similar with a few
differences. But the functionality
for tokens, for dividends, and all the
things that we spoke is going to be
added in the future (with) the hard fork

Tron Black>
yes

Donald MacIntyre>
The general structure, mmm I guess it's a
VM, the blockchain, the currency, the
consensus mechanism, programming language...

Tron Black>
There's no VM. So that's kind of an ethereum
concept where you have to be able to run
code and have to protect the rest of your
computer from it. There will not be a VM
in (Ravencoin). It's a UTXO model which is
like Bitcoin, transactions are inputs
and outputs creating the transaction
which is a similar kind of thing to a lot of
the technology that goes into creating
assets and has already been written multiple
times. Starting with by JR Willett, who we're in
contact with, then it was Omni, then counterparty. 
They all use a similar model, a protocol that
rides inside Bitcoin.
We're going to put those two together and as we
put them together we actually make it a
little more seamless. There's some
clunkiness when you have a second tier
protocol on top of bitcoin. You
have to worry about actually losing the
assets by sending the Bitcoin without the assets,
things like that. So we'll be able to
solve those because it'll be in the same
codebase.

Donald MacIntyre>
At the block level then, just to
clarify, instead of ten minutes it's one
minute and then for now I read that it's 
a 1 megabyte (blocksize) like Bitcoin. 
You're planning to increase that to X
megabytes? What is that (number)?

Tron Black>
Right, well I'm not exactly sure what number
we're going to use and increase it to but we
are in contact with BloXroute which
has a system that allows blocks to
propagate faster and they're working
with a number of different crypto
currencies at the moment and so we may
be able to speed it up more than most people
think you're able to do with with the
current system.

Donald MacIntyre>
Very good, So the currency is called RVN, 
instead of 21 million theres going to
be 21 billion and therefor the block reward 
instead of 50 like Bitcoin was originally, it 
is going to be 5000 per block. And the issuance 
schedule is in proportion but the same exactly the same

Tron Black>
Yeah so the timing of the block halving is identical to
Bitcoin's. We actually had to increase the number of blocks
before it halves so that we can get that same four year halving.

Bruce Fenton>
If it was ten minute blocks then it would be
exactly the same as Bitcoin with three
zeros added on so it's still basically-
just picture ten minute blocks with adding three
zeros to 21 billion instead of million
only we adjusted everything to divide by 
ten because its one minute blocks. 

Donald MacIntyre>
The current consensus mechanism is the
proof-of-work inherited from Bitcoin but
I read that you were planning to change that in...  

Tron Black>
We have already changed it. So the (original planned) proof of work
mechanism has been swapped out(before launch).(Our new mechanism) was in the
initial release, it's called x16r. What it  
does is- it's somewhat innovative. I mean
there's already a couple coins that have
copied what we're doing. So Bitcoin just is kind of a double shot 256. 
Then there was some other innovations from DASH: 11 algorithms chained
together, (then) some people made 13 15 17(chained algorithms)
We took 16 of those algorithms but instead of going in a fixed
order which is what DASH and all of the other ones do,we 
actually changed the order based on the last bytes of the previous
block. Which means they're reordered every time.

Donald MacIntyre>
Randomly. 

Tron Black>
So that's the innovation (that) gives us a little bit more
asic resistance, not asic proof. But we also have a commitment
to swapping the algorithm, doing some changes, if someone
builds an ASIC for it. That's because we want a good distribution
(and) Asics tend to concentrated in data centers and those 
can be, I guess stopped, if necessary. (We aim) to keep this more the
people's coin, so it's being mined  by gamers and machines that are just out
there all over the world.

Donald MacIntyre>
So that's part of the philosophy that I'm going to ask about later. 
So the x16r is already working and it rotates like quasi or semi
randomly between protocol to protocol so it prevents a company like 
Bitmain to build something?

Tron Black>
It is random each block but it
is deterministic each block because
everybody has to do it exactly the same
way so they have to look at the hash
from the previous (block) to determine the
order.

Donald MacIntyre>
yeah so there's not only consensus of the hash
of the block but also consensus of what 
proof-of-work (is) used for the next block 
in terms of structure. The last question
is: Who are the types of participants?
I think that what we spoke (about) before is
that there's only one kind of node and
it can be a miner or economic node but
there's one kind of node for now. 

Tron Black>
yeah, I mean you can run the node without mining
and like I said it can help propagate transactions 
but you just run the software and it works and so
that's just one kind of node so there's no master nodes
and (as to)the type of people, it's all over the place. We have a
fantastic community, it's one of the best parts of this coin,
is the community and support that its getting

Donald MacIntyre>
The reason for my question is
Bitcoin started in 2009, and also had one
kind of node everybody was miner and
node and everything at the same time.
Today we clearly have a division of
power between users or economic nodes
and miners. Even if there are Asics in the
case of Ethereum there's also that
division of power, and with Casper
they're going to add another Casper
friendly finality gadget (that) they're going
to add a validator which is a third kind
of participant. In your case, for now it's early stage
network so for another node is only one
maybe in the future there's going to be
a separation between miners or
specialized miners and and nodes do you
plan to have some hybrid like add
validators in the future or something
that?

Tron Black>
Not currently on the roadmap

Donald MacIntyre>
So it's a pure proof-of-work. Okay regarding policies
now philosophy, the first philosophy is bootstrapping. Can you
or Bruce maybe talk about the bootstrap and the community spirit and stuff like that?

Bruce Fenton>
Sure yeah, we try to make this as
fair and open source as we could and really just let the
community do it's thing. Because a lot of the infrastructure that
has been built around tokens isn't really suited for that, and a lot of the
new people and including you know the Reddit cryptocurrency subreddit has 600,000 people.
When I started, there was no such thing, the Bitcoin one had like 30,000.
So the ecosystem has grown and a lot of new people, hundreds
of thousands (of) new people have never even actually seen a real open-source project
that's that's proof of work. So a lot of the systems that are built around this
are suited for, you know, centralized tokens, corporate coins. We have a lot of
people asking, "do you want to do a joint venture do you want to sign a
press release do you want to support this" and the answer is, "but there's no we"
We're just individuals. We've kind of joked, "we'll sign whatever
paperwork Bitcoin signed" (because) Bitcoin can't sign a paper and neither can Ravencoin.
It truly is an open source type of thing that we're trying.
There has to be somebody who has a
Twitter or who's on a github (like) Tron (who) is a centralized person
where he's going to accept commits
but as far as we can, we're trying to make it as as decentralized as possible.
so we try to be very fair with the mining and that changes a lot of
things. It's very interesting because it really does(matter) it's not (that it)just sounds like
some kind of new agey marketing thing to say it's the people's coin or belongs to other
people but we've tried to make it that way where there was no developer (fund) set aside
or founder shares or pre-mine or anything like that. We tried to make it like so
it really is out there where people can do what want with it (and) those policies, 
I think, are sort of a best practice hopefully so...

Donald MacIntyre>
It's an organic growth, started with one
person, then another person, and now
there's thousands of people. And that's
perfectly okay to have a lead developer
as long as there are different participants
in the network, it still keeps decentralized, and
permissionlessness. And part of your
philosophy was not to do a pre-mine and no ICO?

Bruce Fenton>
We were very lucky that because we're the next
generation of crypto people. So Tron's been in 
crypto a long time I've been in crypto a long 
time, we were able to put some time in
ourselves, where we didn't have to worry
as much about saying here's a big financial risk.
We've already been in crypto so we were able
to put a lot of money and a lot of effort into it and
then (to) make it even more fortunate,
we had a super generous benefactor in the form
of of Medici/Overstock/Patrick Byrne. They just
really like this project. It fits with
their model and what they're doing so
that changed the economics. I don't
think ethereum could have done that
because I remember that first 18 million
was a lot of money back then and I don't
think they would have been able to pay for
an office or pay for anybody to do anything
so the economics changed a little bit because
of the way that the world (has) evolved. And also
frankly it's a lot. A lot of people
wouldn't want to do a model like this
because you don't get rich off it. You can
get rich potentially maybe if by some lucky thing
this coin does really well. There's a
whole bunch of other things that would
have to happen for it to have value. It has
to work; not only it has to work, it has
to make sure nobody else does a better
job in executing everything. But even if
all the stars align and the coin does
great you're not going to make any
money on it by being involved in starting
it unless you take economic risk. So even if
you were there day one, you didn't get anything
unless you spent a lot of money mining 
to accumulate a bunch of coins. And so it does
spread it out a lot better which I think it's not
something a lot of projects are
going to want to pursue. But for this
type of project, that we want to make a
real global standard, we want to get the
big corporations and the individuals and
the real cypherpunks. And also on other end
of the spectrum the large corporations they don't really
want to work on a project that's
designed to make (a founder rich). If Tron had 
30% set aside they're not stupid, the big
corporations are going to say, "okay well
you build your thing we're not going to support that project
to make some single person richer" or
(support) something that's captively
controlled by a corporate audience. So we know
the philosophy wasn't just trying to be
"hey cypherpunk go-" it was a business decision 
that if we want this thing to work, we
want solutions that work for us and
others we want to build a real network
and a way to do that is to do it the same
way bitcoin did it, the same way you know
that successful project worked: you just
let it be open.

Donald MacIntyre>
So Tron, Bruce, Patrick Byrne, Medici,
and overstock, they are just
helping the project because they believe
in the project they don't have any
special allocation of tokens since the
beginning. If anybody wants token they
just install a node and mine but aside
from that they can buy it in the market etc.
I forgot to disclose (I bought) about four
thousand Raven yesterday, it's like a
hundred and sixty dollars at the time so
I also am a holder of Raven.
But so let's talk about the philosophy of
security. I think it was very very clear
when we spoke on Twitter and also when I
read on the whitepaper that
security is a high priority for Ravencoin
similar to Bitcoin.
So there's several tensions there:
security is one thing, and
sometimes hard forking like you're
planning to do and smaller smaller block
times and larger blocks can go against
security at least in the minds of many
people. Can you tell me about that
tension, if there is any tension or how
you rationalize that?

Tron Black>
Yeah I mean we're basically a fork of
Bitcoin so the security should inherit
those same security models.
The tension with block propagation
times, higher speed blocks (and) things like
that are really related to centralization or block propagation
times and so we're kind of solving both
of those. Block propagation times we have
connections with some people that are
building technology to do faster block
propagation times that would push beyond
what most people think are(possible)
if we need to. Right now
there's really only two coins
with that scaling issue. I mean
everybody might have scaling issues but
right now it's pretty much Bitcoin
and Ethereum having scaling issues because
they're popular and they're
starting to get (to) those limits. Most of the
other coins don't have that issue but
we're already working to kind of solve
those (issues) in advance so if you want
to look at something like BloXroute
you can look at that technology- we're
talking to them. So that allows you to
increase the block size and increase the
block speed because it's how fast you
can get the block to the other nodes so
everybody's mining on the 
same blocks. You don't have Forks and you
don't have orphans so that's part of it.
That's kind of one of the things that
that Bitcoin was worried about
increasing the block size, was block
propagation times, they also have some issues
with....

...potentially could have you know
a cluster run in the data center
propagation or we have centralization
issues so we've already solved that,
we're not going to have asics
we're going to have GPUs people who are
basically just mining around world so
kind of solve the two problems that
allows us to push it you know not to
infinity but certainly larger than
what people (have been) talking about recently.

Donald MacIntyre>
What your saying is that the central problem of a
distributed network like Ravencoin
with twenty thousand nodes all over the
world is propagation time?

Tron Black>
How fast you can get the last solved block to everybody so
everybody's working on the same solved
blocks, so everybody has consensus, then
everybody's working on the same thing you
wont have to worry about waiting six blocks(for confirmation time).

Donald MacIntyre>
Bitcoin, it's conservative so they
decide to keep the block at the
one megabyte even though with segwit
it's much more efficient than before and
moreso it's scaled better and to keep the
ten minutes. Here you lowered it to one
minute and you're going to increase to more than
one megabyte because you have solved
the propagation issue?

Tron Black>
We can expand more than it has,
more than one megabyte. I don't
think that's the problem. But we also
have some solutions that basically can
sit on top and propagate faster yeah so...

Donald MacIntyre>
Are those solutions network solutions like ISPs helping you?

Tron Black>
They are network solutions, read the Bloxroute paper
it does some things where it propagates the
transactions kind of in advance, and then
it propagates. It basically sends a
hundred times less data because it can
basically say the block is constructed
with these transactions to put
that together. So it's a bolt-on
solution, you don't really need to use it
until you have scaling issues which is a good problem to 
have lots of transactions lots of users.

Donald MacIntyre>
For engineers, which is the whitepaper that explains that?

Tron Black>
That's actually Bloxroute

Donald MacIntyre>
And that's on the website the
ravencoin.org website? 

Tron Black>
It's not on the website, its not
something that ravencoin needs currently
and if we need it for scaling
technologies there..

Donald MacIntyre>
Okay so what you're saying is that 
you can marry high security and a priority of security
even though if you are lowering the
block time and increases the block size
because of these efficiencies in routing

Tron Black>
right there's a tension between the
scalability and security. We think there's some technology that helps all that.

Donald MacIntyre>
I mean, if ravencoin already has one minute
blocks and you're going to add more than
one megabyte blocks that means that the
BloXroute system is going to be
integrated to Ravencoin at some point
no?

Tron Black>
It may be, if we get to that scale level.

Bruce Fenton>
It depends on a lot of things. It depends
on how other scaling solutions (like)
lightning(do) and there's so much work 
being done on this that by the time this
is a problem hopefully the Lightning Network
will have solved it and a lot of other things
(will have been) solved and we can we can
use some of those solutions as well. 

Tron Black>
We can piggyback on top of all of those solutions because
we're basically a fork of Bitcoin so
all the segwit stuff all the lightning-
those are all solutuions that will be built in. 

Donald MacIntyre>
Okay when is this tension or this dichotomy between
security and block size and propagation
and all the issues that we spoke I think
it's very important and maybe
engineers and technical peoplewho understand
the technology specifically
should explore it further but I don't
think it's a minor issue to say oh now
this is solved it's going to be okay. 

Bruce Fenton>
Remember we're only a one megabyte blocks now,
yes so that's one reason we didn't have a block increase
when it first came out. 

Donald MacIntyre>
When the time comes the explanation has
to be there also.

Bruce Fenton>
For sure yeah, I mean
I think if we were to say okay you
know four megabyte block size
starting with a fork in a month that
would be a massive problem. We may never
increase the block size and it
really depends on what happens, but you
know certainly security is is going to be
the first thing. We've been watching all
of those conversations like everybody
has for the last couple of years.
The whole purpose of why we copied
Bitcoin was because (its) one of the most secure
basic chains. It'd be crazy to go (elsewhere) when
you have all these experts, some
of the brightest minds, in Bitcoin that
are very acutely aware of this issue. You
wouldn't want to ignore that and so it's 
more like a theoretical thing, when and 
if scaling becomes an issue. 

Donald MacIntyre>
Also the philosophy of adding stuff by forking it
can be controversial. In Ethereum
it is not a problem and maybe it's
justified because of the level of
complexity of that network. (But) in
Bitcoin it is a problem and maybe it's
also justified because of the lower
level of complexity it's just a ledger
with accounts and balances so why why
risk it.

Tron Black>
The biggest aim here is that people aren't
following- and so you know there's
been multiple forks with different coins.
Monero is kind of going through this
now. They said, "we're going to stay asic
resistant" (and) another group said, "and we're
not going to follow you" and so there'll
likely be a few forks of Monero so you
know that that's one of the bigger
dangers that can end up getting two coins.

Donald MacIntyre>
Yeah the hard fork evidently adds new 
features or you can fix stuff from the 
past a bug or something like that and... 

Tron Black>
Well if everybody follows you it's a non-contentious
hardfork. It's an upgrade if everybody follows the miners 
It's just an upgrade (and) it's not a problem. 

Donald MacIntyre>
What the hardforks have is something about
the future which is to change the rules for the better for the
future and a hard fork doesn't include
the people of the past. A softfork
includes the future and the past so I
think that's that's the main difference
that as a risk it could mean that it
gave because soft and hard forks are
subjective decisions between humans it
could increase the risk of introducing
human decisions into into the blockchain
like censorship or account freezing or
blocking an account from the past or
stuff like that so that's why I think
Bitcoin has that strong ethos of
definitely no hard Forks to minimize the
subjective part in this case. 

Tron Black>
The code's available for everybody to see if the code has
something that says, "we're going to block
something" then (the)community doesn't (have to)follow along.
Miners don't (have to) follow along I mean that's the only thing that you
really need to worry about us is that code is what the community wants.
(If)the community agrees then it should move smoothly
it doesn't always move smoothly meaning (i.e) Ethereum classic and there will
probably be Monero classic I mean but then you have to two different paths 

Donald MacIntyre>
Well it seems then that your
philosophy is that hard forking in
itself is not that risky outside of just
leaving some people out if they don't
want to jump?

Tron Black>
There are coins out there
that have a regular planned hard fork
it's just an upgrade that the community
moves along with it and it's yeah I mean
its really up to the community you know and
that's really where the protection comes
from. The miners aren't going to
to switch over to the software if you
put something stupid in the software
they need to know, and should know
what the upgrade is so that you
don't have somebody coming into the
developers and say hey we're going to
change this, and this has to go out. The
miners are a there for a reason, to say
no, this is a bad change and so
if you have a whole bunch of that, you
can have a bad change the miners shouldn't switch.

Donald MacIntyre>
Bruce do you share the same philosophy regarding
hardforks?

Bruce Fenton>
Yeah I think so. I see what you're
saying is that, if you if you make a
regular practice it's just more of a
chance that somebody could could try and
make it contentious or sneak
something in but I think the attitude is
kind of you know very cypherpunk
manifesto ish which is just sort of like
hey here's code you know we're not
promising anything other than what the
code says and if somebody likes that
kind of vision that we put into what the
code is then great and if not then you
know they don't have to come along with
anything anybody says. Or there
isn't any way that developers- we don't
have any power- the moment that January
third came along we lost all power over this
we can't affect a fork we can't say here's the fork
and right now in these early stages most
people tend to want to follow what Tron
is saying because they wouldn't be involved in the project.
Otherwise you'd get into a project,
three weeks in,and say, you know, I hate this project.
You wouldn't bother getting in the project
in the first place so I think the first
fork will probably be pretty
straightforward but you know just
given the math I'm sure that there would
be a chain- likely a minority chain that
stays with the Ravencoin classic and
that can do whatever they want. And if
that becomes a great project, great
but yeah, I think that the attitude
is just sort of like you put it out
there, you publish it, and people can run
it or not run it. It's sort of
the ultimate governance mechanism at
least that I know of for a project
like this.

Donald MacIntyre>
I think that now that you're going to add the new features
everybody knew that since the beginning
and that had hard fork in it's not going
to be contentious and there's not going
to be any security issues and the
network is small etc I'm sure that as
time passes by the community in general
is going to like think a lot before
there's a new hardfork. 

Tron Black>
Yeah they should think a lot. They should think a lot 
and look at the code and yeah they really
should. They are the ones that are in
control, the miners.

Bruce Fenton>
And it should be hard, it should be something that you
don't want to have any developer have
the ability to say oh I'm going to fork
this or something or because we have to
think even though this is a tiny little
experimental -I use the word experimental
and people mistake that to think that
we're not serious about it- we are
serious about it, we are serious about an
experiment- but it is an experiment in
the sense that anybody who
says they know something is going to
work, is probably lying. We don't know it
will work, we hope we're going to put
everything we can into trying to make it
work, but it's even a tiny experimental
project like this we want to plan for
the future- be attack proof, we want to
plan with the kind of like hyper
paranoid level of security that Bitcoin
has that's why you have a network and
when you get to that level of network
you have to say ok has Tron been
compromised by a government? are they
making him do something and making him
disguise it in a way that we wouldn't
see? You have to do that,
you have to think adversarially in crypto and
Bitcoin is probably the best example I
know of where it's very adversarial both on
whether it's crypto Twitter or
the way that people do their personal
security or how they hold their
backpacks or how they communicate.
Everything in bitcoin is adversarial
Which is good for an early simple kind of
experimental stage project, you don't have that kind of contention.
Hopefully nobody would be bothered to go
and make physical threats against Tron
for our little project, they'd just go and
do their own. But if this thing works and
it becomes a real serious chain that has
billions or trillions of
dollars on it well then, we have to
plan now to make these baby steps to say
okay what kind of best
practices for governments are there and
those would include making sure that
there's nobody (that) really has any
power and it's all about the code. Going
back to the cypherpunk manifesto: it's
just here's the code. people can run it
or not run it, and hopefully you end up
with a vibrant community that does
checks and balances on that.

Donald MacIntyre>
You mentioned governance, so regarding
governance voting is also going to be a
feature on the network but voting is 
only for the security tokens or the
tokens but not at the protocol layer no?

Tron Black>
The voting is really so that you can have this
token and communicate with people and allow them 
to give feedback. the feedback would basically be taking the
tokens that you sent them and then they
can send it back to different
addresses that you've designated. You can
tell them that  via message because it will 
have messaging and if people want to
build websites (to) make this easier
to just click and drag or whatever for votes
that'll be possible, the chain will
contain the results of the vote and the
protocol for the vote but you know there's
probably an easier way to vote than, "I'm going to
send this vote token to this address"

Donald MacIntyre>
So it's for the tokens and at the
protocol layer is going to be like Bitcoin
it's just adoption or people running the
code is the vote that you support the
code. Addons-
So we already spoke about the features
that are going to be added in the future
and regarding the protocol and
side-chains. Is RSK going to be compatible with
Ravencoin? does it have segwit or
lighting Network?

Tron Black>
It should have segwit
I don't know if it has the newest
changes that were added in the most
recent Bitcoin update but it should be
it should be Bitcoin compatible so those
things should work.

Bruce Fenton>
And we do have compatibility with RSK, I'm an investor
in RSK and good friends with those
folks and have talked to them.
There isn't any like formal way to talk
because it's not a "this is a corporate
project" so somebody just has to contribute that
code and I've talked to those
guys (to) see if they know people that are
interested. Certainly RSK is a
natural fit for this because the goal of
it is to at least have one potentially
large use case B securities type tokens.
The kind of smart contract functionality
that RSK allows by making so you can use
solidity on the Bitcoin chain would be
exactly perfect for this. And
the great news also is that we
don't have to do anything different for
the roadmap or any of the work that Tron
and the other developers do because
somebody can just build the RSK and make
it work just like the RSK built for
Bitcoin. So the two-way peg with ravencoin
and RSK is pretty straightforward,
so that would be great if (somebody is)
going to create a token they'll find
advantages in this. But 
code is indifferent to it. If they want to 
create a token on that it's
great and especially if they want to
have a smart contract functionality some
of the functions that we don't have that
would be good and I think it gets really
powerful when you combine the two. Say
we have Ravencoin native assets and then
you have an RSK smart contract that runs on
the same block chain as those, that can
influence some of these more advanced
smart contract type of features, but your
using a native token that's hopefully
more secure and easier to use RSK would
be great.

Donald MacIntyre>
Lightning. did you mention that?

Tron Black>
Yeah lightning just requires segwit so
people can already do that

Donald MacIntyre>
very good if I'm a developer or user, where are the
resources? ravencoin.org is the website, wallet, what items are
available for me to start?

Tron Black>
Yeah so the client will look a lot like the
Bitcoin client. So we have a graphical
client for Linux, Mac, and Windows and
then also the daemons and normal daemons
and command-line tools that the Bitcoin
has so those all exists,(and) you can
download those now. We will likely have
fairly soon Android and iOS wallets as
well for SPV wallets.

Donald MacIntyre>
The current wallet is Ravencoin QT 
and it's a full node and soon
you're going to have SPV's for phones

Bruce Fenton>
And you can get those if you go to the Ravencoin.org
site and click the official binaries
which brings you to github. This is
easy for technical people it's not
too hard for non-technical people but
you go to ravencoin.org you click where the
github is that brings you to github and
there's a section called binaries and
then in there it has your operating
system so if you're windows, you go to the
windows section I think there's four
executables that you download you
download all of those and that'll be the
raven qt wallet so it's pretty simple even
for a non techie should only take 
five minutes to get you going.

Tron Black>
if you're a Mac user you just download the dmg and it
installs, if your windows user just
download the Qt it just runs. you don't
need all the binaries unless you're
going to do command-line.

Donald MacIntyre>
It's easy to find everything there on
the website. And is there a block
Explorer?

Tron Black>
There is a block Explorer.. I believe
there's two now, they're community driven
projects. They've just built them and we link to them.

Donald MacIntyre>
And chats like discord or telegram?

Tron Black>
There's a discord, there's a telegram.

Bruce Fenton>
Yeah there's two discords, Discord is mostly
community-driven, again we try to-
there's benefits some drawbacks of
trying to control things so we tried
to just let the community do it but yes so
there's the discord. I'd love to get anybody's 
advice figuring out the best way now that
the roadmap and the updated paper are out to
figure out the best ways for public
dev communication. Tools like
discord and telegram are great for
communicating with a large number of
people but it's not so
great for development communication so
we'll be setting up or somebody 
would be setting up something like that
as well.

Donald MacIntyre>
I think in general Ravencoin 
is very interesting because
you decided to focus on this it's
like a network with a with a very
important feature and specialize in
issuing assets not tokens. And with the
voting dividends all those features I
think it's very good as a stock
broker, like you know Bruce we value that
because it gives the functionality of
how the real world has worked for a
long time but also because it creates
the incentive, for example, for me as an
entrepreneur to create a startup on
Ravencoin. I think it's very attractive
instead of going through Delaware and
and creating the corporation
and all that which is very cumbersome
and also for people to issue tokens the
the incentive of the potential future
value of the tokens is a driver for
people to come and work on on Ravencoin.
So I think that's a very big positive
the only thing that I see is
this like dichotomy between
security but at the same time modifying
the block features and having a
philosophy of hard forking so I would
say that in my only personal opinion 
Ravencoin has a philosophy of total
security like Bitcoin but it's really a
little bit above because it needs to add
all of these features and hardfork in
the future and also this anti ASIC
philosophy opens a little bit the space
for hard forking in the future again
of course Ethereum is much more
liberal and they like to hard fork and
make changes and they openly say that
they would make a change if there is a
malicious very obvious malicious user on the
network and stuff like that so it's
different but I would say that Ravencoin
is just about Bitcoin in terms of
security. 

Bruce Fenton>
One important note the difference with
it and with Ethereum: One motivation
for this I think is that there are
securities issuers who want to have a
chain that is maybe more immutable than
Ethereum. I mean it was a negative to
some people that Ethereum changed for
the DAO but not so much maybe
because they're concerned about the DAO
or the whatever-it was small amount-
thirty million at the time, but the fact
that it shows that it can be done, sets a
dangerous precedent because there's much
much more important things that are
going to happen if you're building a
serious chain that's serious for the
world and serious for global economy.
There are much more serious things that
are going to happen than some joker, 
not even hacking, it was really just
an unintended use of smart
contracts, really an exploitation. You're
going to have 9/11 scale
attacks, you're going to have wars, you're going to have
nations at war with each other, you're
going to have crazy dictators who have come
into power, if you if you look at things
on on a you know decade-plus
type of thing you're going to have much
bigger challenges. So Ethereum caved
for that then it's certainly possible
that a state actor or something else
could order them to make a change or
revoke somebody's coins and that's
a very very difficult road that you
don't really at least in my opinion don't
want to go. Some people feel okay, no
problem, you know, do the right thing and
change it, but I think then you get
back into a centralized database and I
don't want speak for anybody else on the
project, but I don't think most people on
the project should have... well they
certainly shouldn't have the power to
even do those kind of changes. But I
don't think they even want to be in a
position where somebody would order them;
where you have somebody if somebody sends me a
court order saying hey change this
guy's balance, you know, I have no power
and and we want to create a system where
Tron has no power, nobody has the
power to affect that.

Tron Black>
There's only really the
distributed miners that would be able to
look at the code and say, "wait a minute this is
rollin stuff back we're not accepting this"
so I don't have the power either
all I can do is change the code
and say hey here's the changes this
why we did them, with the hope that if
they're the great, changes that we've already
written down (and) said we're doing that I'll
accept them but there's no guarantees. I
mean that's just something we don't have absolute
control over

when I recently wrote what I call the
ten principles for blockchain governance,
which are just a guide of principles
that I observed from from the blockchain
space in the last six years and one of
the things that I wrote was "least
authority". And that is for the community
only to implement modifications and
future changes with only the technical
rationale in in mind but not social
issues and stuff like that, and to leave
all the social issues like crime
and bad actors etc to the traditional
world and to the legal system.

Yeah, we touched on that a little bit in the
in the whitepaper. In a global economy, 
again this isn't new-age
cypherpunk hippie philosophy,
this is real I think serious
business, I don't think that it works in
a global economy if you have a captive
list where you have a central party or
semi centralized party who can decide
who gets blocked and this guy's a hacker
and this guy's a terrorist and this
guy's on the OFAC lists or we're going to block
this and this and this.
I don't believe personally that can work
in a global economy because Israel and
Saudi Arabia and Taiwan and China and
the Dalai Lama are not going to agree on
who gets banned. So then what happens? we
say oh well we got an OFAC we go to the
UN and we go to some centralized body
and say okay the rich white nations get
to decide who gets banned who's a
terrorist and who's not a terrorist. I
don't think that'll work in a global
economy because you're going to have 
even something as simple as China and
the United States- especially right now
with this looming trade war- they may not
agree on who the next bernie
madoff is and whether you should
seize his tokens or not so it just
becomes a big big big mess. Where as soon
as you have anybody who has that kind of
power it will inevitably be co-opted by
OFAC, the World Bank, whoever (with) some
kind of huge centralized power that gets 
to say, "yes these people are terrorists if
you block these addresses and don't
block those addresses". Once you do that I
don't think it's really real
crypto anymore and it breaks- so it's not 
a philosophy thing. Although, I
think everybody involved in this project
has a very kind of you know freedom
focused cypherpunk sort of personal
philosophy that's not really the only
reason to do it. From a pure business
standpoint the most businesslike person who doesn't care at
all about cypherpunk values who doesn't
care at all about freedom should be able
to objectively look at this and say,
"you know what, this is good business"
because as soon as you give China the
power to ban or OFAC the power to ban or
the World Bank or the United States UN
or some centralized organization
everything doesn't work. In some country
or countries typically basically all of
Africa they're going to get left out in
the cold like they always have been. So
for it to work in a true global
economy -this isn't the days where people just
keep their money in their own town bank
anymore- you need to have money be able
to move from Nigeria to China to Kansas.
And so I think it has to be open and
then and that's just a burden
for the regulators in each
individual jurisdiction. If the United
States wants to have all kinds of
onerous laws preventing it that's
their business, they're going to have to do
that, but I don't think it works if
somebody tries to do it on a protocol
level.

And I would say that for ravencoin maybe
minimizing in the future the frequency of forks would help
in closing that potential loophole.
Well guys thank you very much for your
