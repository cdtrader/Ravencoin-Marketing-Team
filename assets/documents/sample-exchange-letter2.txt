RVN is an open source project with no owner, no company, no ICO, no pre-mine, no developer set-aside, RVN is a community owned project in the same vein as Bitcoin, but with a slightly different goal. With a built-in asset layer and a fully asset-aware client, RVN is designed for the tokenization and transfer of assets in a way that neither BTC nor ETH were ever intended to be. Boasting features like built-in messaging for token issuers and the option to automatically distribute dividends, RVN is also perfectly suited for security tokens. Integration of RSK even allows RVN to make use of smart contracts and power Dapps, like ETH, but with the benefits of a more secure and immutable chain. Ravencoin is mined via a new custom algorithm known as X16r, which is ASIC resistant by design, thwarting the critical flaw of both ETH and BTC by keeping mining democratic and decentralized. Overstock.com has been investing time and developers to contribute to the project, and even mining the token. The reason for theirs and venture firm Medici Ventures interest, is as of yet unknown. RVN also happens to be a Bitcoin fork so it will be easy to implement in Changelly, and there are community developers available to help you do so. Since no one is in charge of the project, and everyone is encouraged to take action for the project on it's own behalf, I as the creator of RavencoinTalk, a forum that is being built to act as the central community amongst them all, have volunteered as the liasion to request this listing.
